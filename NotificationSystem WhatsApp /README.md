## Module 4 - Notification System
The module 4 implemented a notification system and it consists of:
- `NotificationMedium.java`
- `EmailService.java`
- `AlertSystem.java`
- `SmsService.java`

The module 5 uses the origina implementation and includes a WhatsApp service which can be found in:
- `WhatsAppService.java`

The files with documentation have been already created, but if you do not want any of the documentation leave the following 
files:
- `AlertSystem.java`
- `NotificationMedium.java`
Along side any of the current services that are insdie the project.
- `NotificationMedium.java`
- `SmsService.java`
- `WhatsAppService.java`
You can also look into those files to have an idea on how to add a service or change them to your licking.
Be sure to look at `TestNotifications.java` to see how it is currently working. You will need all of the module 4 and 5 java
files for this.
